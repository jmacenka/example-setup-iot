# Example-setup-iot

A simple template for an UNPROTECTED Lab-Setup of node-red with grafana and influxDB.
Only to showcase the capabilities and quick setup times of this stack. **NOT** to be used for production!
The setup requires manual completion through the Node-Red an Grafana UIs and lacks **ANY SECURITY** aspects on purpose.
